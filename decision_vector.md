The idea that our way of thinking becomes independent of past experiences. Based on personal experience: I tend to forget how I learned things, but still can do these things; also based on alleged report of Alzheimer's victim's relatives' testimonies: supposedly the victim becomes different/unrecognizable when they start to lose their personal way of reacting to situations.

Assuming the simplest of situation, we can represent it inside one dimension. The current situation is represented as a point in our situation's dimension. Applying a decision to the current situation yields a new situation. Applying a different decision would give a different new situation. To represent a more complex situation, we simply consider a dimension for each aspect of the situation. What would reprensent the personality, the way of thinking of a person would then be a decision vector of potentially infinite dimensions.
