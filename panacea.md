I always think that education is a panacea. When I hear about the horrors happening around the world, I tend to think people would not do that if they had a better education. Now that I am trying to articulate what that education is, trying to understand what the word education mean, I think _cognitive development_ is a more appropriate term. It is something that happen naturaly, through interaction with one's environment. But then, if it is something that come from interaction, that can be studied, why can it not be taught ? If it can, and I believe it does, why is not happening ? Most likely I am not aware of these *courses*, whether the target are the parents, the childs, or general education practitioners such as teachers. I have got to search for that, but considering how important I consider this is (remember that first sentence), I wish it was more publicly available.
